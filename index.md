## Apiman task

### Tools
- I decided to use linux tools for this project.
- I used docbook to create the source file, then pandoc to generate the PDF.
 - I used the default stylesheet, so the PDF looks like a standard LaTex document.
- I edited the docbook file using vim , on a Fedora 28 Workstation platform.

### Research

- The setup steps were describes thoroughly in [crash course in apiman](http://www.apiman.io/latest/crash-course.html#_getting_the_bits_downloading_apiman)
- It was not always obvious in online apiman documents which version of apiman they referred to. So some of the instructions are invalid. One source indicated that the apiman quickstarts apis are preconfigured in apiman; they are not, for the version I installed.
